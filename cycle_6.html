                For this project I decided to do a picture box for my older brother. Getting started on the box, I used a similar design for my card box from an earlier project and adjusted the dimensions so it could house several 4in x 4in wood cut outs. Afterwards I adjusted the size of the lid so it'd fit into the box and then put some holes in the sides so it'd take less time to print (12 hours compared to 15). Once I was finished with the design I sent it to the 3D printer.

                Moving on to the "pictures" I chose to laser cut several drawings of some frogs along with one picture of my brother and I. I opened all of the images in adobe illustrator and rasterized them. Then i converted the color photo of my brother and I to grayscale. with help from my professor we put all of the images on one document and adjusted each image to have a 4in by 4in border. Afterwards we sent this document to the laser cutter.

                Finally, having both the box and the pictures, I can put the pictures in the box and give it to my brother. :D
